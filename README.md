Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP)

This repository contains material to support the proposal for the Darwin Core Data Package (DwC-DP) model and format, and supports open discussion through [Issues](https://github.com/gbif/dwc-dp/issues).

When a version is ready to release, the schemas for DwC-DP are copied to the [schema repository](https://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/experimental/data-packages/) for use by tools, such as the GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT).

The goal is that this repository will be transferred from GBIF to TDWG and for the Darwin Core Maintenance Group to maintain the resources, including schemas, if DwC-DP is ratified as a Vocabulary Enhancement to Darwin Core.
