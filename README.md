Darwin Core Data Package schemas

This repository contains schemas to support the proposal for the Darwin Core Data Package format, and supports discussion through the [Issues](https://github.com/gbif/dwc-dp/issues).

When a version is ready to release, the schemas are copied to the [schema repository](https://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/experimental/data-packages/) for use by tools, such as the GBIF IPT.

The aim will be for this repository to be transferred from GBIF to TDWG if accepted, and for the Darwin Core Maintenance Group to maintain the schemas.
